        <h1> About Us</h1>
             <p>Welcome to Ambuvigil.
                 
Our website uses crowd sourcing to determine the closures/problems and overall status of sidewalks in the five boroughs of NYC. 

We have Google Maps to make us aware of  the problem on the roads and we have Ambuvigil for the sidewalks.
         The form at the end of the page would be for people to submit street problems they come across throughout the day. For example you're walking and then you see that 34th street is blocked 
 
        due to construction you would go to the website and submit the address to the database. We'd then update the alert section to let our users know the current status of the city streets.
